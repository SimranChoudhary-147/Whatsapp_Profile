WhatsApp Messenger is a free instant messaging app available on both Android and iPhone. It allows you to send text messages to other users one-on-one or in groups. Importantly, WhatsApp chats go over the internet. This contrasts with standard SMS texting, which goes through your phone provider.


Inside chats, WhatsApp has all the features you'd expect from a modern messaging app, including the option to send photos, share your location, search and send GIFs, and similar. In addition to the core texting service, WhatsApp supports voice calls, video calling, and recorded voice messages.

Data members ( attributes ) are accessible publicly.
Make all the attributes private.
Generate getters for all the attributes.

Part 2: Upon initialization, an object of the Profile class will have invalid initial values for the attributes.
Create a Parameterized Constructor which will allow you to initialize the attributes with valid values.

Data types for attributes profilePhotoUrl and lastSeen are not chosen wisely.
Choose the data type for profilePhotoUrl which can represent the URI in a better way.
Choose the data type for lastSeen which can represent the LocalDateTime in a better way.

Input validations are missing for methods performing mutations of attributes.
Identify the scenarios where attributes can go into invalid state.
Based on the identified scenarios, perform validations in the methods where attributes are mutated.
